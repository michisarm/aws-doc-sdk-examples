# DynamoDB code examples for the SDK for Go

## Overview

Shows how to use the AWS SDK for Go (v2) to create Amazon DynamoDB
tables and move data in and out of them.

*Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and
predictable performance with seamless scalability.*

## ⚠️ Important

* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account. 
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege). 
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

### Scenario

* [Get started using tables, items, and queries](scenarios/scenario_movie_table.go)

* [Query a table by using batches of PartiQL statements](scenarios/scenario_partiql_batch.go)
  
## Running the examples

### Get started using tables, items, and queries

This interactive scenario runs at a command prompt and shows you how to use DynamoDB
to do the following:

- Create a table that can hold movie data.
- Put, get, and update a single movie in the table.
- Write movie data to the table from a sample JSON file.
- Query for movies that were released in a given year.
- Scan for movies that were released in a range of years.
- List tables in your account.
- Delete a movie from the table.
- Delete the table.

Install all required resources and start the example by running the following in the 
`dynamodb` folder at a command prompt.

```
go mod tidy
go run ./cmd -scenario movieTable
```

### Query a table using PartiQL

These two scenarios show you how to run PartiQL statements to query a DynamoDB table of
movie data. You can do this one at a time or in batches. Both scenarios add, get,
update, and delete movies in the table.

Install all required resources and start the example by running one of the following in 
the `dynamodb` folder at a command prompt.

```
go mod tidy
go run ./cmd -scenario partiQLSingle
go run ./cmd -scenario partiQLBatch
```

### Prerequisites

Prerequisites for running the examples for this service can be found in the
[README](../README.md#Prerequisites) in the GoV2 folder.

## Tests

Instructions for running the tests for this service can be found in the
[README](../README.md#Tests) in the GoV2 folder.
